This is the REST API for the [[https://github.com/jakub-stastny/rpm.meta][rental property management system]].

If you wonder where is the source code, it's not in the source control â€“ not directly anyway. Since I'm using literate programming, all the source code is organised into chapters. Just [[./chapters][start reading]], everything will become clear, including how to export source code out of the chapters and run the app.
