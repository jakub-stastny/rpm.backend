* About

Literate DevOps script to set up the current project.

* Installation
** Emacs packages

We want to keep environment-specific configuration out of our =~/.emacs=.

That's what =.env/emacs.el= is for and here we install all the packages specific to the project's environment.

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp :results silent
  (dolist (package '(clojure-mode cider))
    (unless (package-installed-p package)
      (message "~ Installing %s." package)
      (package-install package)))
#+END_SRC
