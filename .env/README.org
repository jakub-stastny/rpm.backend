* About

Literate DevOps script to set up the current project.

* Installation
** Emacs packages

We want to keep environment-specific configuration out of our =~/.emacs=.

That's what =.env/emacs.el= is for and here we install all the packages specific to the project's environment.

*** [[https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil-collection][Package evil-collection]]

Magit buffers don't support Vim movement keys (=hjkl=) by default, which is what the =evil-collection= package is about.

It supports other common packages, not only Magit.

*** [[https://magit.vc][Magit]]

Use =C-x g= to enter the mode.

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp :results silent

      (message "~ Installing %s." package)
