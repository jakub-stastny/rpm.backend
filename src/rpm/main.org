* Main
** Design decisions
*** Separation of pure and impure functions

In a normal web app (such as this one), a lot of the functionality inherently deals with the database and is impure by definition. Still let's try to use pure functions as much as possible.

*** Testing
**** Unit testing
**** Integration testing

Hit the endpoint directly. Maybe worth doing from Ruby/rSpec?

*** Data format for back-end/front-end communication
**** TODO: Decide between JSON and EDN

I might go with EDN here.

*** Logging

Let's log to =STDOUT=, as recommended by the [[https://12factor.net][12-factor app methodology]]. It will run in Docker anyway.

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure :tangle main.clj
  (ns rpm.main)

  (defn -main [& args]
    (println "Here"))
#+END_SRC
